Hi, my name is Carlos Zuluaga. I am a passionate and curious Civil Engineer. My interests are split between management, safety, leadership, and technology applied to construction. 

During my doctoral studies in the [Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering at North Carolina State University](https://www.ccee.ncsu.edu/), my research focused on improving the overall safety, efficiency, and productivity of bridge maintenance workers by applying innovative methods such as virtual prototyping and wearable technology.

When not at my office, you're likely to find me out in the woods mountain biking, climbing, or hiking.
