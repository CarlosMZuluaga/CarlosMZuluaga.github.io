Welcome to my website.

I am a Civil Engineering Ph.D. Student in the department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering at North Carolina State University. I currently perform research in the area of construction safety under the direction of [Dr. Alex Albert](https://www.ccee.ncsu.edu/people/alex_albert/).

I invite you to visit the other tabs of this website to find more information about myself and topics of my interest.
