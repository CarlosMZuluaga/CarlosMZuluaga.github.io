Today I have decided to migrate my website from the Wordpress site offered by NCSU. Although it was a to set up this GitHub including the [minimal-mistakes](github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme, I believe it offers more felixbility than Wordpress and will allow me to keep running my site after graduating. 

Thanks for visiting and look forward for postings future postings.
