Hello, and welcome to my website.

I am Carlos M. Zuluaga, currently a Ph.D. Student and research assistant in the department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering at North Carolina State University. I am working on the project entitled “Compatibility Testing of Supplemental Fall Protection Devices on NCDOT Bridges” under the direction of Dr. Alex Albert.

I invite you to visit the other tabs of this website to find more information about myself.

Go Pack!
